# Micro-B-Development-Board
The Micro-B development board is based on the ATMEGA328 microcontroller. It is an all-in-one board to help engineers take on several beginner and intermediate projects in embedded systems with the components all in one place.With this in place, they can do rapid PoCs with ease.
This repository contains the KICAD schematics and PCB designs.
